# Maria Podobrazhnykh Website

This file contains project-specific rules and guidelines for the codebase.

## Project Overview
- **Main Portfolio Page**: Professional UX/UI design portfolio (originally from Tilda)
- **Sailing Page**: Information about sailing trips and adventures (originally from Webflow)

## Implementation Approach
- Maintain original assets and functionality
- Use Next.js framework with TypeScript
- Follow "minimal changes" approach
- Preserve design while adding type safety
- Static export for optimal deployment

## Directory Structure
- `/public/` - Static assets
  - `/main/` - Assets from main portfolio page
  - `/sailing/` - Assets from sailing page
- `/src/` - Source code
  - `/app/` - Next.js App Router pages
  - `/types/` - TypeScript type definitions
- `/out/` - Static export output (after build)

## Development Guidelines
- Preserve original styling and functionality
- HTML converted to TSX with minimal modifications
- Static export for Vercel deployment
- Keep original asset paths consistent

## Technical Stack
- Next.js (with static export)
- TypeScript
- HTML/CSS (original from Tilda/Webflow)
- Vercel or any static hosting service for deployment

## Building and Deployment
- Run `npm run build` to generate static files in the `/out` directory
- Deploy the `/out` directory to any static hosting service
- For Vercel: connect GitHub repository and configure build settings
- Set output directory to `out` in Vercel project settings

## Future Considerations
- Component refactoring
- Performance optimizations
- Comprehensive TypeScript typing
- Responsive design improvements
- Tailwind CSS integration

## Note About Raw Files
The `__raw` directory contains original source files and is temporarily kept in the repo for reference.
