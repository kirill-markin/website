  - `/sailing/` - Assets from sailing page
- `/src/` - Source code
  - `/app/` - Next.js App Router pages
  - `/types/` - TypeScript type definitions

## Development Guidelines

- HTML converted to TSX with minimal modifications
- Optimize for Vercel deployment
- Keep original asset paths consistent

## Technical Stack
- Next.js
- TypeScript
- HTML/CSS (original from Tilda/Webflow)
- Vercel for deployment

## Future Considerations
- Component refactoring
- Performance optimizations
